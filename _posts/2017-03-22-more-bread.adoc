|==================================

As the dough of the spelt version (Recipe 1) was a bit too much on the wet side, I reduced the water content last week to 55%, see recipe 2.

While I got a very nice loaf out of it, this time the dough was a bit dry and the crumb structure was to close for my taste.

I used the same ratio for a pizza I did the day after, adding about 4% olive oil, which worked very well.

Next spelt bread: 57% hydration.

I also introduced a 5 minute break into the kneading process, which now runs:

* 5 minutes kneading
* 5 minutes rest
* 5 minutes kneading

This I'll keep.
